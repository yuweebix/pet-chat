# Pet-Chat
## Go Real-Time Chat Application

This is my pet project implementing Chatting functionality with the new features of Go 1.22.

## Technologies and Methods

- **Backend**: The backend uses Go 1.22 with the hopes that the new advanced routing capabilities will be enough to route to create a full-fledged app that looks decent.

- **Middleware**: For this project I have implemented middleware that does logging, checks for whether a user is authenticated or not and chaining.

- **Database**: Seeing as it's a fairly small project, I opted to use GORM with PostgreSQL as its dialect.

- **Frontend**: The frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and HTMX will be used to add interactivity to the web pages without the need to write JavaScript or use React.
